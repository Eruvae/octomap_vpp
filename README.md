# octomap_vpp

## Description

This package provides custom octrees as extension to the [octomap framework](http://octomap.github.io/). They were create for the [roi_viewpoint_planner](https://github.com/Eruvae/roi_viewpoint_planner). The following octrees are available:

- **RoiOcTree**: This class extends the OccupancyOcTreeBase class of the octomap framework. In addition to keeping track of occupancy probability, a region of interest (ROI) probability is stored for each node. Scans with detected ROIs can be inserted using the insertRegionScan method.

- **InflatedRoiOcTree**: Helper octree, generated by computeInflatedRois method of RoiOcTree. Used to inflate detected ROIs by a given distance. The InflatedRoiOcTree nodes contain a single float value that indicates the distance from the nearest ROI - lower values are further away from ROIs.

- **WorkspaceOcTree**: Octree to specify the workspace of a robot. Each node contains a float value between 0 and 1, indicating the reachability of the position. Can be generated from a CountingOcTree.

- **CountingOcTree**: Slightly modified version of the [octomap CountingOcTree class](https://octomap.github.io/octomap/doc/classoctomap_1_1CountingOcTree.html). This version returns the correct string in getTreeType and offers an additional method to compute mean and variance of the leaf counts. Can be used to generate a WorkspaceOcTree.
